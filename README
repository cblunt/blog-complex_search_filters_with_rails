== Installation

The easiest way to obtain a copy of this code is to use git:

  git clone git://github.com/cblunt/blog-complex_search_filters_with_rails.git

You might need to install some gems:

  rake gems:install

After cloning, install the ez_where (http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/ez_where)
plugin into your local copy:

  ruby script/plugin install http://opensvn.csie.org/ezra/rails/plugins/dev/ez_where

Set up a local config/database.yml file, e.g

  # config/database.yml
  development:
    adapter: sqlite3
    database: db/development.sqlite3
    pool: 5
    timeout: 5000

Finally, migrate and populate your database with:

  rake db:migrate
  rake db:populate:users
